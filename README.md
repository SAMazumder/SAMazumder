Former mathematician (?). B.Sc., M.Sc. Applied Math. from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) with a focus on Coherent Risk Measures and their assymptotic properties.

My math interests lie in Functional Analysis, Probability and Stochastic Processes. 

Right now, my github is just a repo for any work I have saved. I'll organize it at some point.
