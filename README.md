Hi, I’m @SAMazumder
I'm a MSc.Applied Math candidate at Ryerson University with a focus on Coherent Risk Measures and their assymptotic properties.

Right now, my github is just a repo for any work I have saved. I'll organize it at some point.

<!---
SAMazumder/SAMazumder is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
